# CountryInfo-API

A web application built with the purpose of expanding my knowledge in REST API and navigating through appropiate fields within the Json file. For this reason, I kept the front layout at a minimum. This web app is part of a larger project that I have been working on. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser or[visit my website](https://www.danielmeneses.com/index.html#proj-desktop) to see program output. 

To authenticate: API keys (free registration) from [country layer](https://countrylayer.com/) and [weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com/) need to be put in .env file to run the program. It is unfortunate that country layer put some of the endpoints that used to be under the free tier behind a paywall.
