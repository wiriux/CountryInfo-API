# CountryInfo-API

A web application built with the purpose of expanding my knowledge in REST API and navigating through appropiate fields within the Json file. For this reason, I kept the front layout at a minimum. This web app is part of a larger project that I have been working on.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To authenticate: API keys (free registration) from [country layer](countrylayer.com) and [weather api](weatherapi.com) need to be put in .env file to run the program.
